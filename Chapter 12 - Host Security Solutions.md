1. Secure Hardware - security is not useful if the hardware is compromised. Hardware needs to have a hardware Root Of Trust (hROT or RoT) that says the hardware is secure. This is typically done by a cryptoprocessor called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). 
	1. TPMs are part of the processor.
	2. TPMs are hardcoded with a unique unchangeable asymmetric private key that endorses keys generated by the device.
2. Boot Integrity means that the boot process is as factory standard and not injected with some sort of hostile action such as an OS replacement. This is typically done with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).
	1. Secure boot uses UEFI to check the bootloader and kernel against a stored certificate from valid OS vendors. Basically, it's a hash check using pre-calculated values. Requires UEFI, but doesn't require a Trusted Platform Module.
	2. Measured boot uses platform metrics to check that the system state is hashed to correct values. Errors are recorded, but boot processes will continue. Presence usually means unsigned boot code.
	3. Boot Attestation is the ability to send the boot log, certified by the TPM, to a remote server for analysis.
3. (Full) Disk Encryption protects the contents of a drive/volume with encryption. FDE requires a key to encrypt or decrypt a drive, normally stored on a TPM chip or USB drive. This has a performance overhead.
	1. Some drives encrypt themselves/have their own TPM function. This removes the performance overhead of encryption from the computer processor to the drive.
4. Third Party components should be vetted to ensure that they are kept up to date. This can be enforced via legal agreements.
	1. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): is an informal  agreement that is used to express an intention to collaborate.
	2. Business Partnership Agreement (BPA): basically buyer-seller
	3. Nondisclosure Agreement  (NDA)
	4. Service Level Agreement
		1. Measurement Systems Analysis: An agreement to measure the quality of service and processes to evaluate via data collection. Generally supports SLAs.
Beyond Hardware, it is important to Harden your system aka put them in a secure configuration. 
1. Standard Hardening steps
	1. Lock down unused interfaces and ports. If the machine uses a wired connection, turn off the wireless interface.
	2. Set services and applications to use known ports and document which ones. Nonstandard port usage should be flagged for review.
	3. Encrypt disk space.
2. Set Baseline configurations and registries so you can detect anomalies from intrusions.
3. Patches should be applied in batches to account for potential application incompatibilities. Patches should also have their contents validated.
4. Hosts/Endpoints should have local antivirus defenses.
	1. Local antivirus/antimalware
	2. Local Host-based intrusion detection
	3. The goal is to detect, protect and isolate infected hosts
Embedded Systems also need to be hardened and protected as they are potential springboards or entry points to other systems. Examples of Embedded Systems:
1. System on a Chip: Raspberry Pis, Arduinos. Full system on a small ship and board, typically lower performance than a full host but can still be targeted because they retain the full host capabilities albeit slower.
2. Field Programmable Gate Arrays: Prototyping logic boards.
3. Real Time Operating Systems: Operating component of smart components such as meters and flow valves.
Embedded system can use communication networks outside of Ethernet or WiFi.
1. Operational Technology Network: Cabled network for industrial applications, typically with serial or ethernet cabling.
2. Cellular Networks: aka Baseband radio
	1. Narrowband-IoT: typically used for sensors that connect to a cellphone network
	2. LTE Machine Type Communications
	3. All use a SIM card as the identifier, issued by the cell network provider.
	4. Encryption is typically the domain of the provider which can augment the encryption the embedded system uses itself.
3. Z-Wave and Zigbee: typically used for home automation systems, both create a mesh network of connected devices. Main threat comes from rogue devices and attacks that attempt to hijack a pairing or connection.
4. Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are basically the communication channels used in an industrial setting to control device PLCs (which may be an embedded system). Typically these are controlled by human-machine interfaces (aka control terminals). A central control and logging system for ICSs is a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and typically control PLCs via WAN.
5. Building Automation and Internet Of Things typically automate functions around a building or residence. These may also interact with items that are worn by people who work and live in those areas. Both are still vulnerable to attacks that use rogue access points or devices. 
	1. Building Automation also covers Industrial Control Systems and may be targeted to exploit vulnerabilities in inputs or communication processes. PLCs might be less complex than a full host, but communicate using the same protocols and systems and may be sending messages in plaintext rather than encrypted.
Embedded Systems can be protected by some of the usual strategies:
1. Segment devices on a different network - out of band management applies to prevent mixing of control traffic.
2. Wrappers  - while embedded devices might not encrypt their data well due to performance constraints, they can route their communications to a device to encrypt the data for them.
3. Manage supply chain - Embedded/IoT devices may not be designed to be patched or updated and can have vulnerabilities from the vendor. Choose which supplies you use carefully, ideally having update agreements.
